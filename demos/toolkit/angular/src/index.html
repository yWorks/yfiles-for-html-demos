        <h1>Angular CLI Demo</h1>
        <p>
          This demo shows the integration of yFiles for HTML with
          <a href="https://cli.angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>How this demo was created</h2>

        <p>
          The structure of this demo was created using Angular CLI with the
          <code>--minimal</code> option, which skips scaffolding testing and git integration.
          Afterwards, the two TypeScript configuration files <code>./tsconfig.json</code> and
          <code>./src/tsconfig.app.json</code> were merged into a single file:
          <code>./src/tsconfig.json</code>. This is so that IDEs like WebStorm and Visual Studio
          Code can provide better code completion and error messages, as they only recognize
          TypeScript configuration files if their name is exactly <code>tsconfig.json</code> (<a
            href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-28091"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >WebStorm issue</a
          >,
          <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12463" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >VSCode issue</a
          >).
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, two Angular components were created:
          <br />
          <code>ng generate component graph-component</code>
          <br />
          <code>ng generate component properties-view</code>
        </p>

        <h2>Integrating yFiles</h2>

        <p>
          To include the library css file, it was added to the <code>styles</code> array in
          <code>angular.json</code>. The license files can be imported in the <code>main.ts</code>
          file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The build process uses a custom webpack configuration file with the help of the
          <code>@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser</code> builder. This allows the use of the
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yworks/optimizer">@yworks/optimizer</a> package in
          production, and a separate yFiles chunk.
        </p>
        <p>
          To run and build the app, you can use the regular <code>ng serve</code> and
          <code>ng build</code> commands.
        </p>

        <h2>App Generator</h2>

        <p>
          Use the

          to create visualization prototypes – quickly and easily.
