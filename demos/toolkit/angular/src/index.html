  <div class="demo-sidebar-content">
    <p>
      This demo shows the integration of yFiles for HTML with <a href="https://cli.angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>How this demo was created</h2>
    <p>
      The structure of this demo was created using Angular CLI with the <code>--minimal</code> option, which skips
      scaffolding testing and git integration. Afterwards, the two TypeScript configuration files
      <code>./tsconfig.json</code> and <code>./src/tsconfig.app.json</code> were merged into a single file:
      <code>./src/tsconfig.json</code>. This is so that IDEs like WebStorm and Visual Studio Code can provide better
      code completion and error messages, as they only recognize TypeScript configuration files if their name is exactly
      <code>tsconfig.json</code> (
      <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-28091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebStorm issue</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSCode issue</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, two Angular components were created: <br>
      <code>ng generate component graph-component</code><br>
      <code>ng generate component properties-view</code>
    </p>

    <h2>Integrating yFiles</h2>
    <p>
      To include the library css file, it was added to the <code>styles</code> array in <code>angular.json</code>.
      The license files can be imported in the <code>main.ts</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The build process uses a custom webpack configuration file with the help of the
      <code>@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser</code> builder. This allows the use of the
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yworks/optimizer">@yworks/optimizer</a> package in production,
      adding yfiles-typeinfo support during development, and a separate yFiles chunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could also add yfiles-typeinfo support by adding it to the <code>scripts</code> section
      of the <code>angular.json</code> file. However, this would also add debugging support to the
      production build, which is usually undesirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run and build the app, you can use the regular <code>ng serve</code> and <code>ng build</code> commands.
