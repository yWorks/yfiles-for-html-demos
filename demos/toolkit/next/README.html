          <h1>Next.js Demo</h1>

          <p>
            This demo shows how to integrate yFiles in a
            <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a>
            application with
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >TypeScript</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>To start the demo</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-ts/toolkit/next</code></li>
            <li>Run <code>npm install</code></li>
            <li>Run <code>npm run dev</code></li>
          </ol>
          <p>This will start the development server of the toolkit.</p>

          <p>
            The integrated development server of the project will automatically update the
            application upon code changes.
          </p>

          <h1>Deploying Next.js with yFiles</h1>

          <p>
            There are no special caveats that you need to look out for when you load yFiles as NPM
            dependency as in this demo application. However, we recommend including the
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yworks/optimizer" target="_blank"
              >@yworks/optimizer</a
            >
            when you deploy your app for production.
          </p>
          <p>
            The optimizer will obfuscate the public API of the yFiles library files, as well as
            yFiles API usages in application sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            We highly recommend obfuscating the yFiles for HTML library prior to deploying your
            application to a public web server to reduce the download size of the library for the
            end user. Note that, at the time of writing, you are not required to use obfuscation.
