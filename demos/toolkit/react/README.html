      <h1>React Demo</h1>

      <p>
        The React demo shows how to integrate yFiles in a basic <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>
        application based on <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/" target="_blank">Create React App</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To start the demo
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-js/toolkit/react</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run <code>npm install</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run <code>npm run start</code>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>This will start the development server of the toolkit.</p>

      <p>The integrated development server of the project will automatically update the application upon code
        changes.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        Note: The <code>/.env/</code> file with <code>SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true</code> is only necessary due to the
        version mismatch of eslint for the react-scripts and the yFiles demo package. If you use the source code of this
        application outside of the yFiles demo package tree, this file won't be necessary.
      </div>

      <h1>Deploying React with yFiles</h1>

      <p>
        There are no special caveats that you need to look out for when you load yFiles as NPM dependency as in this
        demo application. However, we recommend to include the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yworks/optimizer"
        target="_blank">@yworks/optimizer</a> when you deploy your app for production.
      </p>
      <p>
        The optimizer will obfuscate the public API of the yFiles module files, as well as yFiles API usages in
        application sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        We highly recommend obfuscating the yFiles for HTML library prior to deploying your application to a public web
        server to reduce the download size of the library for the end user. Note that, at the time of writing, you are
        not required to use obfuscation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is how you can include the <code>@yworks/optimizer</code> in this application that was built with the <a
        href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/" target="_blank">Create React App</a> toolkit.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Run <code>npm run eject</code> to gain the full control over the deployment of this application. See also <a
          href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject" target="_blank">npm
          run eject</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then install the dependencies that are necessary to build JSX files, i.e.<br/> <code>npm install --save @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-source</code><br/>
          Now, the application can be started and built with either <code>npm run start</code> or
          <code>npm run build</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then we need the <code>@yworks/optimizer</code> dependency, which you can install with:<br/> <code>npm install --save-dev @yworks/optimizer</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          To include the <code>@yworks/optimizer</code> in the build process for production builds, prepend the
          following plugin in <code>/config/webpack.config.js</code>:
          <pre>
plugins: [
  isEnvProduction && new yWorksOptimizer({
    blacklist: ['render', 'Component', 'nodesSource', 'edgesSource']
  }),
  ...
]
        </pre>
          Don't forget to require it first:<br/> <code>const yWorksOptimizer = require('@yworks/optimizer/webpack-plugin')</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          That's it. When you now build for production with <code>npm run build</code>, the optimizer will do its job
          and the bundle will be obfuscated.
        </li>
      </ol>
