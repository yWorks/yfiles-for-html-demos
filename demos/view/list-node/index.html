        <h1>List Node Demo</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how to display a node with sections arranged in rows. The sections can be
          re-arranged interactively. When a section is moved, its edges are moved as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Add new rows with the context menu (right click). Note that rows which support outgoing
            edges have a port on the right side of the node. Rows which support incoming edges have
            a port that is placed at the left.
          </li>
          <li>
            Connect edges to the ports at the rows by dragging from a port. Edges will always go
            from the right side to the left side of a node, no matter on which side the edge
            creation was started.
          </li>
          <li>Move rows up and down by dragging with the mouse.</li>
          <li>Move an entire node by dragging with the mouse at its header.</li>
          <li>
            Rename nodes and rows by clicking on a node or row label and pressing <code>F2</code>.
          </li>
          <li>Remove rows with the context menu by right-clicking on them.</li>
