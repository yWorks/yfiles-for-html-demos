  <div class="demo-sidebar-content">

    <p>The Gantt Chart demo shows how to create a Gantt component from JSON data.</p>
    <p>The data consists of tasks which define the horizontal lanes and activities, each of which is assigned to a
      task.</p>
    <p>An activity has a start and end date, and optionally a lead time and follow-up time. Also an activity can
      optionally depend on other activities.</p>
    <p>The activity duration is rendered as a solid area. The lead and follow-up times are rendered with a hatch
      pattern.</p>
    <p>The activity dependencies are modeled as edges between the activity nodes.</p>
    <p>This demo uses <a href="https://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">Moment.js</a> to parse, manipulate and calculate dates.</p>

    <h2>Things to Try</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Scroll the tasks using the mouse wheel.</li>
      <li>Scroll the timeline horizontally using shift + mouse wheel.</li>
      <li>Hover over an activity to highlight its dependencies.</li>
      <li>Hover over a dependency edge to highlight the source and target.</li>
      <li>Select an activity to display the activity information.</li>
      <li>Grab and drag an activity to change the start and end time, or to assign an activity to a different task</li>
      <li>Grab the left or right side of the solid area of an activity and drag to change the duration.</li>
      <li>Select an activity and drag one of the round handles on the left or right to change the lead or follow-up
        time.
      </li>
      <li>Select an activity and press 'F2' to change its name.</li>
      <li>Drag an activity so it overlaps with other activities in the same task lane. The activities are placed below
        each other so they don't overlap.
      </li>
      <li>Drag the mouse on an empty part of a task lane to create a new activity.</li>
      <li>Shift-drag from a node to create a new dependency edge.</li>
    </ul>
