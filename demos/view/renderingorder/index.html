        <h1>Rendering Order Demo</h1>

        <h2>Rendering Order</h2>
        Sometimes it is necessary to change the render order of graph, e.g. when labels should be
        rendered in front of their owner but behind another item. This demo shows how to use
        <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphModelManager" target="_blank">GraphModelManager</a>
        to configure the rendering order for grouped graphs as well as layer policies for labels and
        ports.

        <h3>Hierarchic Nesting</h3>
        <p>
          Each item type is assigned to a specific canvas object group. These groups have a default
          rendering order from back to front. See
          <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/customizing_view-z_order" target="_blank">The Z-order of Graph Elements</a> for more
          information about the different <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/ICanvasObjectGroup" target="_blank">ICanvasObjectGroup</a>s and their default rendering
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          For grouped graphs, we provide some nesting policies to structure nodes and edges in more
          complex hierarchies. In these cases, some of the canvas object groups may not be used.
        </p>

        <h3>Demo Configurations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Default:</em> The rendering order that is used by default.</li>
          <li>
            <em>Labels / Ports at Owner:</em> The labels and ports are rendered on the same z-order
            as their owner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Edges on Top:</em> Edges are rendered on top of the nodes. Note in this case, we
            also enabled the labels and ports at owner configuration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Group Nodes:</em> Maintains the rendering order according to the nesting depth for
            group nodes while nodes and edges are placed in the separate groups and are not
            interleaved in the rendering.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>None:</em> Items are placed in their respective canvas object group without
            considering the nesting hierarchy of the nodes. Usually, this setting is only used when
            the z-order is managed by a different mechanism.
