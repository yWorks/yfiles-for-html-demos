        <h1>Deep Zoom Demo</h1>
        <p>
          This demo allows you to seamlessly zoom into the contents of deeply nested group nodes,
          similar to what is known as "deep zoom" for images and maps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graph component does not display the complete graph but only the nesting level that
          fits the current zoom level. That means that graph items at a higher nesting level are not
          rendered at all, and the contents of group nodes that are too small to provide meaningful
          interaction is displayed as a static image. When zooming in on such a group node, this
          image is eventually replaced with real graph elements.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to try</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Zoom into</strong>
            a group node so that its entire contents fill the current viewport, and observe that the
            displayed graphic is automatically replaced by the contents of the group.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Zoom out</strong>
            of a group and observe that its previous nesting layer becomes visible and the content
            of the group becomes an image again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Click</strong>
            on
            <button id="description-button-zoom-original">
              <img alt="Zoom original" src="../../demo-app/icons/zoom-original3-16.svg" />
            </button>
            or
            <button id="description-button-fit-content">
              <img alt="Fit Content" src="../../demo-app/icons/fit-16.svg" />
            </button>
            to exit all groups and reset the zoom.
          </li>
