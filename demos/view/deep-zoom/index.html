        <h1>Deep Zoom Demo</h1>
        <p>
          This demo allows you to seamlessly zoom into the contents of deeply nested group nodes,
          similar to that is known as "deep zoom" for images and maps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graph component does not display the complete graph but only the nesting level that
          fits the current zoom level. That means that graph items at a higher nesting level are not
          rendered at all, and the content of group nodes that is too small to provide meaningful
          interaction is displayed as a static image. When zooming in on such a group node, this
          image is eventually replaced with real graph elements.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to try</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Zoom into</strong> a group node so that its entire contents fill the current
            viewport, and observe that the displayed graphic is automatically replaced by the
            contents of the group.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Zoom out</strong> of a group and observe that its previous nesting layer becomes
            visible and the content of the group becomes an image again.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Toggle</strong> the smooth scrolling button in the toolbar to enable or disable
            smoothly animated viewport changes.
          </li>
        </ul>
