    <p>
    A demo that shows how to interactively relocate subtrees from one parent to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time that a node is selected, the subtree rooted at this particular node is dragged interactively, and
      <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/ClearAreaLayout" target="_blank">ClearAreaLayout</a> will try to create free space by pushing away the other elements of the graph so that
      the dragged subtree is relocated to another parent.
    </p>
    <h2>Things to Try</h2>
    <p>
      Drag a node with its subtree to another location and see how the graph tries to accommodate it. The node that is
      highlighted will be the new parent of the moved subtree.
