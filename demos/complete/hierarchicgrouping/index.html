    <p>
      The Hierarchic Grouping demo shows how to nicely expand and collapse sub-graphs organized in groups. Folding
      ('collapsed groups') can help to keep complex hierarchically organized diagrams clear and straightforward by
      showing only parts of the entire structure. </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, each user action triggers a run of the <em>incremental mode</em> of the <em>hierarchic layout
      algorithm</em> to ensure that the currently visible part of the graph is always well-organized but remains still
      similar to the previous arrangement. </p>
    <p>
      Recursive edges are edges whose source is inside a group node while its target is outside this group node, and
      vice versa. When those edges leave a group node at the side to reach a node left or right of the group node,
      information to keep the layout stable after expanding/collapsing the group node may be lost.<br/>
      Therefor, a new routing styles is introduced which will preserve this information. This routing style
      forces all edges to enter groups at the top and leave them at the bottom. </p>

    <h2>Things to Try</h2>
