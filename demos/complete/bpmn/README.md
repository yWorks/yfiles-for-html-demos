# BPMN Graph Editor

An editor for Business Process Diagrams (BPMN).

You can interactively modify the diagram and automatically arrange it with the specialized BPMN layout algorithm.

## Things to Try

- Choose a sample diagram from the toolbar combo box.
- Drag node templates from the palette to the canvas to create different BPMN items.
- Connect the items by dragging from an unselected node to another one.
- Auto-arrange the changed diagram with the BPMN layout algorithm.
- Open a popup menu that allows you to customize the item by double-click a node, edge or boundary event. Double-clicking on an empty space closes any open popup.
- Open a context menu by right-clicking a node or edge. The menu provides different actions depending on the clicked item.
- Edit the label of a selected node or edge by pressing `F2`. Note that you can also select the label directly using the detail selection (`SHIFT + Click`).
- Add an additional label to a selected node or edge by pressing `SHIFT + F2`.
