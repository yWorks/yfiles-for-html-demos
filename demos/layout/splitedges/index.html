        <h1>Split Edges Demo</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how to use split ids to align edges outside with edges inside a group
          nodes in <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/RecursiveGroupLayout" target="_blank">RecursiveGroupLayout</a>. In <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/RecursiveGroupLayout" target="_blank">RecursiveGroupLayout</a> the routing
          for inter-edges is sometimes not satisfactory. Inter-edges are edges that connect nodes
          outside of a group with nodes inside of this group. Since RecursiveGroupLayout routes
          these edges after the rest of the graph is arranged, they sometimes don't fit into the
          overall layout style.
        </p>
        <p>
          In combination with <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/HierarchicLayout" target="_blank">HierarchicLayout</a>, inter-edges can be replaced with two
          edges that are aligned at the group node. <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/HierarchicLayout" target="_blank">HierarchicLayout</a> provides the option
          that an edge is routed directly from the border of a group nodes to a node inside of this
          group node instead of leaving the group node first.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>
        Change the graph and the split ids of the edges and see how the layout changes, too. Edges
        with split ids are colored different than black.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Align edges that connect to the same group nodes from the outside and the inside. Select
            two or more edges that are connected a group and choose 'Align Selected Edges' from the
            context menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unalign edges to delete the split ids. Select at least one edge with a split id and
            choose 'Unalign Selected Edges' from the context menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select an inter-edge and split it into several edges that connect to the formerly
            crossed group using the context menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select an aligned edge and join it with all edges that have the same split id using the
            context menu.
          </li>
          <li>Split all inter-edges of a group node with the context menu of the group node.</li>
          <li>
            Join edges at a group node that share a split id with the context menu of a group node.
          </li>
          <li>Normal nodes and edges do not provide a context menu.</li>
        </ul>
