    <h2>EdgeRouter with Bus-style Routing</h2>

    <p>
      This demo shows how to configure the EdgeRouter to generate orthogonal bus-style routes. A bus is a segment shared
      by multiple edges. The actual nodes are attached to the bus with shorter segments.
    </p>

    <p>
      A bus is defined via the <em>add</em> method of the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/EdgeRouterData#buses" target="_blank">buses</a> property.
      The method yields an object on which the set of edges can conveniently be defined, e.g., via a delegate.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/EdgeRouterBusDescriptor" target="_blank">EdgeRouterBusDescriptor</a> class provided to the <em>add</em> method offers
      settings related to a bus.
    </p>

    <p>
      This example showcases two buses which are defined differently.
    </p>

    <h3>First Bus - Automatic Backbone</h3>
    <p>
      The first bus (<span style="color: #FF6C00; font-weight: bold;">orange graph</span>) is defined using a default
      descriptor and with no further settings. This means that the algorithm automatically chooses backbone segments.
    </p>

    <h3>Second Bus - Given Points</h3>
    <p>
      The second bus (<span style="color: #242265; font-weight: bold;">blue graph</span>) is defined by
      <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/EdgeRouterBusDescriptor#busPoints" target="_blank">manually providing</a>
      the location of the backbone segments. The manually defined backbone
      consists of a vertical segment to the left of the nodes and two horizontal segments in-between the node rows.
    </p>

    <h3>Code Snippet</h3>

    <p>You can copy the code snippet to configure the layout from
      <a href="https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-for-html-demos/blob/master/demos/04-tutorial-layout-features/edge-router-buses/EdgeRouterBuses.ts"
         target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Demos</h3>

    <p>The <a href="../../layout/busrouting/index.html">Bus Routing Demo</a> is a more complex demo that shows
      the bus-style routing feature. More features offered by the EdgeRouter algorithm are shown by the
      <a href="../../layout/layoutstyles/index.html?layout=edge-router&sample=edge-router">Layout Styles Demo</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Documentation</h3>

    <p>The Developer's Guide provides more information about the concepts of the
      <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/polyline_router_bus_routing" target="_blank">Bus-style routing</a> feature of the EdgeRouter.
