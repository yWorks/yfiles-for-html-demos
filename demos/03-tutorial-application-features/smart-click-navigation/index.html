    <h2>Smart Click Navigation</h2>

    <p>This demos shows how to navigate in a large graph, especially when only a part of the graph is visible in the
      viewport.</p>
    <h3>Things To Try</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on an <b>edge</b> whose target node or source node is not visible. Then you will notice that the focus
        will be moved to this source or target node.
      </li>
      <li>Click on an <b>edge</b> where both target and source node are visible. Then you will notice that the focus
        will be moved to the middle point of the edge.
      </li>
      <li>Click on a <b>node</b> and you will notice that the focus will be moved to the center of the clicked node.
      </li>
      <li> Choose between two modes in the combo box:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Zoom to Viewport Center.</em> The focused item is in the center of the viewport.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Zoom to Mouse Location.</em> The focused item is centered at the mouse location.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
