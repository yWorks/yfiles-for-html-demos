        <h1>Theming</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how to define a custom <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/Theme" target="_blank">Theme</a> for the graph component. A theme
          affects the color and look of the input handles (e.g. the handles to resize nodes), the
          marquee, the snap-lines, label position candidates, the graph overview marquee and also
          the indicators to select, highlight or focus items. The <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/customizing_view_theming" target="_blank">Theming</a>
          section of the Developers Guide explains the effects of a custom Theme in detail.
        </p>

        <p>
          The custom theme in this tutorial uses a <em>round</em> <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/ThemeVariant" target="_blank">ThemeVariant</a> and a
          scale of <em>2</em> to increase the size of the handles. The primary color is almost
          white, the secondary color and background color are orange-like.
        </p>

        <p>
          This tutorial also shows how to implement a simple switch between a <em>light</em> and
          <em>dark</em> application mode. The styles of the graph items are not affected by the
          theme. If you want to adapt the visualization of the graph items to the selected theme,
          then you can do that as shown here when switching between light and dark mode.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Observe the round handles on the preselected node.</li>
          <li>
            Select, create or move graph elements to see the appearance of the handles and snapping
            lines.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drag a marquee selection and observe that it uses the orange color defined by the custom
            theme.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that the background color of the graph overview component on the top left is
            defined by the color of the custom theme as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Switch between light and dark mode by using the toolbar buttons. Note that the theme is
            not affected by the mode. When switching, the coloring of graph items is changed and the
            background color of the graph component is changed by adding a <em>CSS</em> class. Of
            course, in real-world applications, more elements could change appearance via
            <em>CSS</em>.
          </li>
        </ul>
