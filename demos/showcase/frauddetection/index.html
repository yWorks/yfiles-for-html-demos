        <h1>Fraud Detection Demo</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how <em>yFiles for HTML</em> can be used for detecting
          <em>fraud cases</em> in time-dependent data. Fraud affects many companies worldwide
          causing economic loss and liability issues. Fraud detection relies on the analysis of a
          huge amount of data-sets and thus, visualizations can be valuable for the quick detection
          of fraud schemes.
        </p>

        <h2>Main Graph Component</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Shows the graph according to the current time frame.</li>
          <li>
            Provides additional information for the nodes on <em>click</em> (displayed in the
            right-panel) or on <em>hover</em>.
          </li>
          <li>Highlights fraud rings on <em>hover</em>.</li>
          <li>
            Graph elements, selection and highlight are rendered using the WebGL2 rendering
            technique, if this is supported by the browser.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Timeline Component</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Shows the number of node creation/removal events with a bar for each point in time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contains a time frame rectangle to select which time segment is represented in the main
            graph by <em>resizing/dragging</em>
            it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provides three detail levels (days/months/years) that are switched by
            <em>scrolling</em> anywhere in the component.
          </li>
          <li>
            Updates the highlights/selection in the main graph when
            <em>hovering/selecting</em> bars.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offers a
            <img src="timeline/icons/play.svg" style="vertical-align: bottom" alt="play" />-button
            to automatically move the time frame to the right while updating the main graph.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Inspection View Component</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Opens an inspection view of a fraud ring when <em>double-clicking</em> on fraud ring
            elements or the according
            <img
              src="resources/icons/fraud-warning.svg"
              style="vertical-align: bottom"
              alt="fraud warning"
            />-symbol in the toolbar. Also, hover on a
            <img
              src="resources/icons/fraud-warning.svg"
              style="vertical-align: bottom"
              alt="fraud warning"
            />-symbol animates the viewport to the corresponding fraud component.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shows a single graph component that contains fraud rings along with its own timeline.
          </li>
          <li>Updates the layout when <em>clicking</em> the Layout-button in the toolbar.</li>

            <h2>About First-party Bank Fraud</h2>
            <p>
              In a first-party bank fraud scenario, fraudsters request legal products from banks,
              i.e., new accounts, checks, loans or credit cards. For some period of time, they
              behave like normal customers and pay their debts. However, suddenly they disappear
              with the money leaving no trace behind, since they have used fake identities or
              contact information.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our graph, each person is associated with an address, a phone number, a bank branch
              and a series of bank products (including possible payments for these products). Each
              node is visualized in a different manner based on its type and is associated with
              dates representing the date when an event started and/or finished. For example, when a
              loan was requested and/or was paid back.
            </p>
            <p>
              A typical fraud-scenario involves <em>two or more persons</em> that share the same
              <em>fake</em> personal information such as address or phone number and apply for
              several bank products.
            </p>
            <h3>What to look for</h3>
            <p>
              Fraud rings, i.e., persons that form <em>cycles</em> and share contact information. In
              the demo, they are visualized in <em>red color</em>.
            </p>

          <div id="insurance-fraud-detection" hidden="hidden">
            <h2>About Insurance Fraud Detection</h2>
            <p>
              In an insurance fraud scenario, fraudsters stage <em>fake car accidents</em> and
              require reimbursement from the insurance companies for small injuries and damages that
              cannot be easily confirmed by the companies. Such scenarios may involve some or all
              passengers of the involved cars, the witnesses of the accidents, doctors or lawyers.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our graph, each "accident" node is connected to the involved "car" nodes and the
              persons served as "witnesses". Each person in a car has a role (i.e., driver or
              passenger) and is connected to a "car" node and, maybe, to a "lawyer"/"doctor" node.
              Each node is also associated with the date of the event. The colors of the edges
              represent the relation between the connected nodes as follows:

              A typical-fraud scenario involves the <em>same persons</em> that participate to the
              <em>same series of accidents</em> playing a <em>different role</em> each time, e.g.,
              one time driver, one time witness and two times passenger. In such cases, also, the
              fraudsters can share the <em>same lawyer and/or doctor</em>.
            </p>

            <h3>What to look for</h3>
            <p>
              Fraud rings, i.e., "accident" nodes that form <em>cycles</em> with almost the same
              participants. In the demo, they are visualized in <em>red color</em> .
