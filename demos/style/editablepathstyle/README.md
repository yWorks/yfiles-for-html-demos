# Editable Path Styles Demo

This demo shows how to use [GeneralPathNodeStyle](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GeneralPathNodeStyle) and provide interactive editing handles for the control points of the path.

## Things to Try

- Create new nodes in the canvas and inspect their styles in code.
- Double-click a node to show handles for all control-points of the path that it is defined from.
- Double-click on a segment of the shape to add a new control point.
- Drag one of the handles to see how this affects the shape.
- Right-click on the canvas to deselect the currently visible path handles.
- Right-click on a path handle to remove it.
