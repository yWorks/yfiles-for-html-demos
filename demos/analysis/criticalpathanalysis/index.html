        <h1>Critical Path Analysis (CPA) Demo</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how to perform critical path analysis (CPA) in project management with
          yFiles. Formally, this means identifying the tasks of a project that must be completed on
          time so that the whole project can be completed on time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This example demonstrates the process of building a house. Each node represents a task
          that has to be completed and is associated with a time duration written on its label. The
          width of each node is also proportional to the required task duration.
        </p>

        <p>
          An edge connecting two tasks means that the task of its source node has to be completed
          before the task of its target node and is associated with a transition time duration (see
          the corresponding edge label) which represents the time needed to proceed from the source
          task to the target task.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <span style="color: #f26419; font-weight: bold">orange</span> edges are the edges that
          belong to the critical path. The
          <span style="color: #4281a4; font-weight: bold">dark-blue</span> edges connect tasks that
          should be completed on time otherwise, the whole project will be delayed, while the
          <span style="color: #6c4f77; font-weight: bold">purple</span> ones have slack greater than
          zero, which means that they can be delayed without affecting the completion time of the
          project.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the critical path calculation, we apply the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/RankAssignmentAlgorithm" target="_blank">RankAssignmentAlgorithm</a> and we
          assign to each node a number that represents its rank and to each edge a number that
          represents its slack. Afterwards, we calculate the shortest path between the first/last
          ranked nodes while taking into consideration the slack values of each edge, i.e. the paths
          with higher slack are longer. At the end, we apply a <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/HierarchicLayout" target="_blank">HierarchicLayout</a> such that
          nodes are placed in layers based on their ranking, while the edges that belong to the
          critical path gain priority so that the corresponding nodes incident to them are
          horizontally-aligned.
