      <h1>Demo Utility Files</h1>

      <p>
        The files in this directory implement demo features that are used in more than one specific demo. Like other
        demo code, you can use these files in your own project if it fits your needs.
      </p>

      <h4>ContextMenu.js</h4>
      <p>
        A simple context menu that provides methods to add context menu entries with specific listeners and means to
        open or close the context menu. It is used in any demo that requires a context menu and is especially featured
        in the <a href="../input/contextmenu/index.html">Context Menu</a> demo.</p>

      <h4>DndPanel.js</h4>
      <p>
        A drag and drop panel which can be used to populate a given element with node visuals and the necessary
        listeners. This panel is demonstrated in the <a href="../input/draganddrop/index.html">Drag and Drop</a> demo
        and is also used in any other demo that supports drag and drop of graph elements.</p>

      <h4>FileSaveSupport.js</h4>
      <p>
        Provides a static helper function to save files to the local filesystem. It makes use of the HTML5 file
        download or a proprietary approach in Internet Explorer. It is mainly used in the export demos, like the <a
        href="">Image Export</a> or <a href="">PDF Export</a> demo, though there is also a dedicated <a href="">File
        Operations</a> demo that illustrates how to save a GraphML file besides using implicit approaches with <code>ICommand.SAVE</code>
        or the methods of <code>GraphMLSupport</code>.</p>

      <h4>JsonIO.js</h4>
      <p>
        A helper class that provides methods for JSON I/O of an <code>IGraph</code>. This implementation only supports
        de-/serialization of structural information but it can also be used as a starting point to also include other
        information e.g. item styles. For instance, the <a href="../loading/webworker/README.html">Web Worker</a> demo
        uses this JSON format to exchange the graph information with the web worker.</p>

      <h4>VuejsNodeStyle.js</h4>
      <p>
        A template node style that leverages the powerful data binding and condition rendering features of the <a
        href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html" target="_blank">Vue.js framework</a>. See the corresponding <a
        href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/custom-styles_vuejs-template-styles">template styles section
        in the developer's guide</a> and the <a href="../style/vuejstemplatenodestyle/index.html">Vue.js Template Node
        Style Demo</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <h4>Workarounds.js</h4>
      <p>
        The yFiles for HTML library contains workarounds for several bugs of specific web browsers. An overview can be
        found at <a
        href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/kb/article/704/Browser_issues_and_included_workarounds">Browser
        issues and included workarounds</a>. This helper enables those workarounds only for the affected browsers and
        is used throughout the demos. It is recommended to check if your application's target platform is affected
        from any browser issue and enabled the specific workaround in this user agents.</p>
