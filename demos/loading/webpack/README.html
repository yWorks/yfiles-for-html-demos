            <h1>Webpack ES Modules Demo</h1>

            <p>
              This demo shows how to integrate the yFiles library in a
              <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a>
              project.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div style="padding-bottom: 20px">
            <p>Two fundamental concepts for webpack projects are demonstrated:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">Code Splitting</a></li>
              <li>
                Separate webpack configurations for development and
                <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/">production</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div style="padding: 20px 0 20px 0">
            <div>
              <h2>Running the demo</h2>

              <p>First, install the required npm modules in the demo directory:</p>

              <code> > npm install </code>

              <h3>Development</h3>

              <p>
                For development, the
                <a href="https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/webpack-dev-server"
                  >webpack dev server</a
                >
                offers convenient live reloading support to minimize turnaround times.
              </p>
              <p>
                The dev server will serve the webpack bundles from memory (no bundles will be
                created on disc), update the app bundle and refresh the page when changes are made
                to the source files.
              </p>
              <p>To run the dev server:</p>

              <code> > npm start </code>

              <p>
                The webpack dev server will create the bundles in memory and launch the
                <a href="http://localhost:9003/">generated index file</a> in a browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that the npm start script will run webpack once before starting the webpack dev
                server, so the generated index.html file already exists when the browser first tries
                to access it.
              </p>

              <p>
                When the server runs, try making changes to <code>src/webpack-demo.js</code> and see
                how the app will be updated in the browser immediately.
              </p>

              <p>
                Debugging of application files in the browser's developer tools should work fine, as
                source maps are enabled using webpack's "<a
                  href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/source-map-dev-tool-plugin/"
                  >SourceMapDevToolPlugin</a
                >".
              </p>

              <h3>Production</h3>

              <p>The following build steps are specific to the production configuration:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Append a content-based hash to the bundle filename to enable long-term caching.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/#minification">Minify</a>
                  the bundles using webpack's minification plugin.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>To run the production build:</p>

              <code> > npm run production </code>

              <p>
                Note that the final minification step of the production build may take some time
                (the first "done" message is misleading).
