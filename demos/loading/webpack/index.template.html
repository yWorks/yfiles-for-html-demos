    <p>
      This demo shows how to integrate the yFiles library in a <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack 4</a> project.
      Also note our <a href="https://github.com/yWorks/generator-yfiles-app">yeoman generator</a> that scaffolds yFiles
      projects with webpack 3 and webpack 4.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two fundamental concepts for webpack projects are demonstrated:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">Code Splitting</a></li>
      <li>Separate webpack configurations for development and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/">production</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The demo also shows how the <a href="../../../deployment/README.html">yFiles for HTML deployment tool</a> can be integrated into the webpack build process for
      optimal obfuscation and minification.
    </p>

    <h2>Running the demo</h2>

    <p>First, install the required npm modules in the demo directory:</p>

    <code>
      > npm install
    </code>

    <h3>Development</h3>

    <p>
      For development, the <a href="https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/webpack-dev-server">webpack dev server</a>
      offers convenient live reloading support to minimize turnaround times.
    </p><p>
      The dev server will serve the webpack bundles from memory (no bundles will be created on disc),
      update the app bundle and refresh the page when changes are made to the source files.
    </p>
    <p>To run the dev server:</p>

    <code>
      > npm start
    </code>

    <p>This will create the bundles in memory and launch the <a href="http://localhost:9003/">generated index file</a> in a browser</p>
    
    <p>When the server runs, try making changes to <code>src/webpack-demo.js</code> and see how the app will be updated
    in the browser immediately.</p>

    <p>Debugging of application files in the browser's developer tools should work fine, as source maps are generated by webpack. See
      webpack's <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/">Devtool</a> option for more fine grained configurations.</p>

    <h3>Production</h3>

    <p>The following build steps are specific to the production configuration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run the yFiles for HTML deployment tool to obfuscate and minify the yFiles library along with its usages.</li>
      <li>Append a content-based hash to the bundle filename to enable long-term caching.</li>
      <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/#minification">Minify</a> the bundles using webpack's minification plugin.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To run the production build:</p>

    <code>
      > npm run production
    </code>

    <p>Note that the final minification step of the production build may take some time.</p>

    <h3>Important Note</h3>
    <p>
      yFiles provides <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/index.html#/kb/article/704/Browser_issues_and_included_workarounds" target="_blank">workarounds</a>
      which address several bugs in current browsers. Find <code>demos/resources/demo-util.js</code> as a reference on
      how several of them are enabled for most of the demos and how to enable them for this demo, too.
