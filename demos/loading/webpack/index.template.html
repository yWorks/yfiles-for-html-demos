        <h1>Webpack ES Modules Demo</h1>
        <p>
          This demo shows how to integrate the yFiles library in a
          <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">webpack</a> project. Also note our
          <a href="https://github.com/yWorks/generator-yfiles-app" target="_blank"
            >yeoman generator</a
          >
          that scaffolds yFiles projects with webpack 3 and webpack 4.
        </p>

        <p>Two fundamental concepts for webpack projects are demonstrated:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/" target="_blank"
              >Code Splitting</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Separate webpack configurations for development and
            <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/" target="_blank">production</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Running the demo</h2>

        <p>First, install the required npm modules in the demo directory:</p>

        <code> > npm install </code>

        <h3>Development</h3>

        <p>
          For development, the
          <a href="https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/webpack-dev-server" target="_blank"
            >webpack dev server</a
          >
          offers convenient live reloading support to minimize turnaround times.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dev server will serve the webpack bundles from memory (no bundles will be created on
          disc), update the app bundle and refresh the page when changes are made to the source
          files.
        </p>
        <p>To run the dev server:</p>

        <code> > npm start </code>

        <p>
          This will create the bundles in memory and launch the
          <a href="http://localhost:9003/" target="_blank">generated index file</a> in a browser
        </p>

        <p>
          When the server runs, try making changes to <code>src/webpack-demo.js</code> and see how
          the app will be updated in the browser immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Debugging of application files in the browser's developer tools should work fine, as
          source maps are generated by webpack. See webpack's
          <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/" target="_blank">Devtool</a> option
          for more fine grained configurations.
        </p>

        <h3>Production</h3>

        <p>The following build steps are specific to the production configuration:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Append a content-based hash to the bundle filename to enable long-term caching.</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/#minification" target="_blank"
              >Minify</a
            >
            the bundles using webpack's minification plugin.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>To run the production build:</p>

        <code> > npm run production </code>

        <p>Note that the final minification step of the production build may take some time.</p>

        <h3>Important Note</h3>
        <p>
          yFiles provides
          <a
            href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/index.html#/kb/article/704/Browser_issues_and_included_workarounds"
            target="_blank"
            >workarounds</a
          >
          which address several bugs in current browsers. Find
          <code>demos-js/utils/Workarounds.js</code> as a reference on how several of them are
          enabled for most of the demos and how to enable them for this demo, too.
