        <h1>Vite Loading Demo</h1>
        <p>
          This demo shows how to load yFiles for HTML with
          <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vite</a>
          as a loader for efficient web development and easy builds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, a layout algorithm in a Web Worker thread without blocking the UI or main thread is
          loaded using
          <a
            href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#web-workers"
            rel="noopener"
            target="_blank"
            >Vite's built-in support for Web Workers</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wait for the demo to load and once the layout button has become active (when the Web
          Worker has initialized), push the layout button to run a layout asynchronously
        </p>
        <p>See the sources for details.</p>
        <p>
          Please note that the hot reloading features of this demo are completely
          <b>optional</b> and definitely not required when using yFiles for HTML with vite. They are only
          meant to show a simple example of hot reloading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please see the <a data-dguide="testing-vitest">Vitest</a> section of the developer's guide
          for details about using the Vitest framework with your yFiles for HTML application.
