  <div class="demo-sidebar-content">

    <p>This demo shows how resizing of nodes can be restricted.</p>

    <p>This is done with custom implementations of the interface <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/INodeSizeConstraintProvider" target="_blank">INodeSizeConstraintProvider</a>
      that are
      added to the lookup of the nodes. </p>

    <h2>Things to Try</h2>

    <p>Select and resize the nodes.</p>

    <h2>Node Types</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em class="demo-blue demo-bold">Blue nodes</em> cannot shrink. Additionally, neither side can become
        larger than three times its initial size in each resizing operation.
      </li>
      <li>
        The minimum size of a <em class="demo-green demo-bold">green node</em> is the size of its label. It gets
        never smaller than that.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <em class="demo-orange demo-bold">orange node</em> must always encompass the black rectangle.
        Additionally, it has predefined minimum and maximum sizes.
      </li>
