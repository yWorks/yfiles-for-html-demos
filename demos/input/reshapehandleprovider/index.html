    <p>This demo shows how to implement a custom <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/IReshapeHandleProvider" target="_blank">IReshapeHandleProvider</a>.</p>

    <p>This <em>IReshapeHandleProvider</em> is provided for ports to reshape their
      port visualization.</p>

    <h2>Things to Try</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Select a <em class="green">green</em>
        or <em class="blue">blue</em> port
        and see its reshape handles at its corners. Also note that there
        is a different handle at the center that was provided by the
        <em>IHandleProvider</em> to change the port location.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drag one of the reshape handles to change the size of the port visualization. Note that
        the size can't be decreased below a specific minimum size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press and hold <strong>Ctrl</strong> and see that further reshape handles
        appear on the left, right, top and bottom side of selected ports. These handles reshape the
        port either horizontally or vertically.
      </li>
    </ul>
