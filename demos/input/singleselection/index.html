  <div class="demo-sidebar-content">

    <p>This demo shows how to configure <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphEditorInputMode" target="_blank">GraphEditorInputMode</a> for single selection mode. In this mode, only one
      graph item can be selected at a time.</p>

    <h2>Things to Try</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Toggle single selection mode and examine the differences.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select a single node and toggle its selection state by pressing <code>Ctrl-Space</code>. This works in
        both single selection and regular mode due to a custom command binding.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move the node focus (indicated by a thin dashed line) by holding down <code>Ctrl</code> and pressing an
        arrow key. Toggle the selection state of the focused item by pressing <code>Ctrl-Space</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a look at the source code, especially method <em>enableSingleSelection</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features of Single Selection Mode</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Marquee selection is disabled. Try to drag the mouse over a set of nodes to select them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click-selecting multiple nodes is disabled. Try to extend the selection by holding the <code>Ctrl</code>
        key while clicking another node.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Select All</em> is disabled. Try to select all nodes by pressing <code>Ctrl-A</code>.
      </li>
