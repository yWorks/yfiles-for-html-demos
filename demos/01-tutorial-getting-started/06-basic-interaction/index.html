    <h3>How to add basic interaction.</h3>

    <p>This step shows the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/interaction" target="_blank">default interaction gestures</a> that are provided by
      class GraphEditorInputMode.</p>
    <p>Interaction is handled by <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/IInputMode" target="_blank">IInputMode</a>. <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphEditorInputMode" target="_blank">GraphEditorInputMode</a> is the
      main input mode that already provides a large number of user interaction features, such as moving, deleting,
      creating, and resizing graph elements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click a single element with the mouse to select it. SHIFT-Click the text to select the element's label. To
        select multiple elements, either extend an existing selection by pressing CTRL while clicking, or drag a
        selection rectangle over all graph elements that you want in your selection. CTRL-A selects all elements.
      </li>
      <li>Resize a node by dragging one of the handles that appear on selected nodes.</li>
      <li>Drag a selected node or bend to move it.</li>
      <li>Click and drag an edge at the desired bend location to create an edge bend.</li>
      <li>To create an edge, start dragging anywhere on the unselected source node and release the mouse button over the
        target node.
      </li>
      <li>To create a bend during edge creation, release the left mouse button anywhere on an empty spot the canvas
        while dragging. Click to create more bends.
      </li>
      <li>Nodes may specify multiple port locations (by default, there's only a single port at the node center). You can
        either create an edge directly between these ports, or later move the source or target to a different port (just
        select the edge and drag the edge's source or target handle). Note that custom port locations are not part of
        this tutorial step, but are introduced later.
      </li>
      <li>To create or edit a label, just press F2 when the owner is selected.</li>
      <li>To move a label, just drag it to the desired location.</li>
    </ul>
