      <h1>Creating the View</h1>

      <p style="font-size: larger">How to create a basic view.</p>

      <p>
        This step introduces class <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphComponent" target="_blank">GraphComponent</a>, which is the
        <dguide section="getting_started-application"
          >central UI element for working with graphs</dguide
        >. The application does not provide any interactive features except mouse wheel zooming,
        which is enabled by default. It is merely meant as a very basic example of how to display a
        GraphComponent within a web page.
      </p>

      <p>See the sources for details.</p>

      <p>
        Please note that the subsequent tutorial steps use a web component framework (demo-utils) to
        reduce the amount of code that is needed to demonstrate the relevant features. All of the
        code samples included in this distribution are also feasible using plain HTML and JavaScript
        together with yFiles HTML.
      </p>

      <h4>Important Note</h4>

      <p>
        yFiles provides
        <a
          href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/index.html#/kb/article/704/Browser_issues_and_included_workarounds"
          target="_blank"
          >workarounds</a
        >
        which address several bugs in current browsers. Find
        <code>demos-js/resources/demo-util.js</code>
        as a reference on how several of them are enabled for most of the demos and how to enable
        them for this demo, too.
      </p>

      <h2>App Generator</h2>

      <p>
        Use the
        <a
          href="https://www.yworks.com/products/app-generator"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >App Generator</a
        >
        to create visualization prototypes – quickly and easily.
