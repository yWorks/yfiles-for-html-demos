          <h1>Jest Demo</h1>

          <p>
            The Jest demo shows how to use <a target="_blank" href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> for
            unit testing a yFiles for HTML application.
          </p>

          <p>To run the unit tests:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-js/testing/jest</code>.</li>
            <li>Run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
            <li>Run the unit tests with <code>npm run test</code>.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>yFiles and Jest</h2>
          <p>
            While modern JavaScript (or TypeScript) applications usually use es-modules, Jest's
            support for native es-modules is still experimental. For this reason, es-modules code is
            transpiled. Due to its size, transpiling the yFiles es-modules library is rather slow.
            As workaround, it is possible to map the es-modules variant of yFiles to its UMD
            variant, which does not need to be transpiled. This can be achieved with Jest's
            <code>moduleNameMapper</code>
            configuration option.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some parts of yFiles require a complete DOM implementation, which Jest's JSDOM
            environment does not provide. To still be able to test code that uses yFiles API that
            require a DOM, it is necessary to mock yFiles. See the
            <code>src/ItemFactoryWithMock.test.js</code> file for details.
