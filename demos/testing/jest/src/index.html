        <h1>Jest Testing Demo</h1>
        <p>
          This demo shows how to use <a target="_blank" href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> for unit
          testing a yFiles for HTML application.
        </p>

        <p>To run the unit tests:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-js/testing/jest</code>.</li>
          <li>Run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
          <li>Run the unit tests with <code>npm run test</code>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>yFiles and Jest</h2>
        <p>
          While modern JavaScript (or TypeScript) applications usually use es-modules, Jest's
          support for native es-modules is still experimental. For this reason, es-modules code is
          transpiled. Due to its size, transpiling the yFiles es-modules library is rather slow. As
          workaround, it is possible to map the es-modules variant of yFiles to its UMD variant,
          which does not need to be transpiled. This can be achieved with Jest's
          <code>moduleNameMapper</code> configuration option.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some parts of yFiles require a complete DOM implementation, which Jests JSDOM environment
          does not provide. To still be able to test code that uses yFiles API that require a DOM,
          it is necessary to mock yFiles. See the
          <code>tests/ItemFactoryWithMock.test.js</code> file for details.
