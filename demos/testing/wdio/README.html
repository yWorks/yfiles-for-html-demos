          <h1>WebdriverIO Demo</h1>

          <p>
            The WebdriverIO demo shows how to use
            <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/">WebdriverIO</a> for integration testing
            a yFiles for HTML web application.
          </p>

          <p>To run the integration tests:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Ensure that the demo server is running, see
              <a data-dguide="demos-server#demos-server">The Demo Server</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-js/testing/wdio</code>.</li>
            <li>Run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
            <li>Run the integration tests with <code>npm run test</code>.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The demo starts with an empty graph, but graph items can be created interactively. The
            integration tests test this functionality by simulating node, edge and port creation
            gestures and verifying that the graph instance actually contains the newly created graph
            items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tests are run in both Firefox and Chrome in headless mode. Please note that the tests
            will fail if the corresponding browser binaries cannot be found on your system. If you
            want to see the gestures that are being tested, you can disable the "headless" options
            in
            <code>wdio.conf.js</code> and add an <code>await browser.debug()</code>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/docs/api/browser/debug.html">statement</a>
            at the end of a test in the spec file.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to obtain access to the yFiles API, in particular for access to the
            <a data-api>GraphComponent</a> instance through
            <a data-api>CanvasComponent#getComponent</a>, the yFiles API is exposed globally when
            the application runs in the test environment.
