          <p>
            This demo shows how to use
            <a href="https://playwright.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Playwright</a> for
            testing a yFiles for HTML web application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application under test is the
            <a href="../application-under-test/index.html">Simple Testable App</a>.
          </p>
          <p>To run the test:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Start the <a data-dguide="demos-server#demos-server">Demo Server</a>.</li>
            <li>Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-ts/testing/playwright</code>.</li>
            <li>Run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
            <li>
              Run the test with <code>npm run test</code> or Playwright's test UI with
              <code>npm run test-ui</code>.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The test is run in Chrome, Firefox, and Webkit in headless mode.</p>
          <p>
            After running the test, Playwright automatically creates a directory
            <code>test-results</code> and stores its result there. Run
            <code>npm run show-report</code> to view a summary of the results.
