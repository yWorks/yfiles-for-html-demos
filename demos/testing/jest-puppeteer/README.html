          <h1>Jest Puppeteer Demo</h1>

          <p>
            The Jest Puppeteer demo shows how to use
            <a href="https://jestjs.io/en/" target="_blank">Jest</a> for integration testing a web
            application that uses yFiles for HTML.
          </p>

          <p>To start the demo and run the integration tests:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-js/testing/jest-puppeteer</code>.</li>
            <li>Run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
            <li>Run the integration tests: <code>npm run test:integration</code>.</li>
            <li>
              Run the integration tests in watch mode:
              <code>npm run test:integrationWithWatch</code>.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The integration tests check yFiles functionality by simulating node, edge and port
            creation gestures and verifying that the graph instance actually contains the newly
            created graph items.
          </p>

          <p>
            The tests run in a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer">
              puppeteer environment
            </a>
            instead of the default
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom">jsdom</a>
            environment, because yFiles for HTML needs a common, standards-compliant browser
            environment, which jsdom does not provide (in particular, jsdom lacks a complete SVG DOM
            implementation).
          </p>
          <p>With puppeteer, the tests can run in a full Chrome headless environment instead.</p>

          <p>
            The application under test is the
            <a href="../application-under-test/index.html">Simple Testable App</a>. To access yFiles
            via Jest / Puppeteer, the <a data-api>GraphComponent</a> is set as a global variable in
            that application.
